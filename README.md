Senario:

We're developing a recruiting system that:
1.	The company has several vacant job positions, include JAVA developer, test engineering, and product manager. 
More positions will be available in the near future, like DBA, UX, and so forth.
2.	Once a job position is applied by a candidate, the manager and HR of this position will receive a notification.

Question:
1.	Which design pattern you're going to use to implement the requirements.
2.	Write down your code(with any programming language you preferred, pseudo code is also acceptable),
OR simply draw a UML Class Diagram to clarify your design.
